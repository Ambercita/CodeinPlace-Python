# CodeinPlace-Python
My Python tasks and final project for the "code in place" course imparted by Stanford University.

## Stone Mason Karel

Karel has been hired to build the columns in the Temple of Artemis in Efes. In particular, there are a set of arches where the stones (represented by beepers, of course) are missing from the columns supporting the arches.

When Karel is done, the missing columns should be replaced by beepers.

## 2023 Karel

Help Karel celebrate the occasion by placing 20 beepers, moving Karel one step, placing 23 beepers, and moving Karel one more step.

## Jigsaw Karel

Karel has picked up a new hobby: doing puzzles! Karel is trying to complete this puzzle made up of beepers.

## Fill Karel

No matter the size of the world, Karel should fill it with beepers.

## Khansole Academy

A program that helps other people learn addition! Write a program that randomly generates a simple addition problem for the user, reads in the answer from the user, and then checks to see if they got it right or wrong.

## Quilt

A quilt, as you may know, is a blanket often composed of repeating "patches".
This program creates a quilt pattern using Canvas graphics.

## Baby Snake

Baby version of the classic Atari game of Snake. It was famously shipped on the original Apple II computers as well as Nokia phones.

# Final Project - Shoot the Target

This is a game about shooting targets as fast as you can.  

You've got 30 seconds to shoot as many targets as possible.  

You will get 5 points for hitting bullseye, 3 points for hitting the middle zone and 1 point for hitting the outer zone.  

But be careful, the more targets you hit, the harder it will become.  

Good luck! ;)
